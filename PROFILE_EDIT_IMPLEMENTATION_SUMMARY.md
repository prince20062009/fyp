# Profile Edit Implementation Summary

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Added Update Profile Controllers

#### User Controller (`backend/src/controllers/user.controller.js`)
- Added `updateUserProfile` function for patients and admins
- Added `updateDoctorProfile` function for doctors

#### Doctor Controller (`backend/src/controllers/doctor.controller.js`)
- Added `updateDoctorProfile` function for doctors

### 2. Updated Routes

#### User Routes (`backend/src/routes/user.routes.js`)
- Added PUT `/patient/update` route for patient profile updates
- Added PUT `/doctor/update` route for doctor profile updates
- Imported the new controller functions

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Created Reusable Profile Edit Form Component

#### ProfileEditForm Component (`frontend/src/components/ProfileEditForm.jsx`)
- Created a reusable form component that works for both patients and doctors
- Implemented role-specific fields:
  - For Patients: age, address, emergency contact
  - For Doctors: department, specializations, experience
- Added form validation
- Integrated with API utilities for saving updates

### 2. Updated Dashboard Components

#### Patient Dashboard (`frontend/src/pages/dashboards/PatientDashboard.jsx`)
- Added profile editing state and functions
- Integrated ProfileEditForm component in the profile module
- Added view/edit toggle for profile information

#### Doctor Dashboard (`frontend/src/pages/dashboards/DoctorDashboard.jsx`)
- Added profile editing state and functions
- Integrated ProfileEditForm component in the profile module
- Added view/edit toggle for profile information

### 3. Updated API Utilities

#### API Utilities (`frontend/src/utils/api.js`)
- Added `updateUserProfile` function for patient/admin updates
- Added `updateDoctorProfile` function for doctor updates

## Key Features

1. **Role-Based Fields**: The profile edit form shows different fields based on the user's role
2. **Real-time Updates**: Profile changes are immediately reflected in the UI and localStorage
3. **Form Validation**: Required fields are validated before submission
4. **Loading States**: Visual feedback during save operations
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failed updates
6. **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## API Endpoints

- `PUT /api/v1/user/patient/update` - Update patient/admin profile
- `PUT /api/v1/user/doctor/update` - Update doctor profile

## How It Works

1. User navigates to the Profile section in their dashboard
2. User clicks "Edit Profile" button
3. ProfileEditForm component is displayed with current user data
4. User makes changes and clicks "Save Changes"
5. Form validates the data and sends a request to the appropriate API endpoint
6. Backend updates the user/doctor record
7. Frontend updates the UI and localStorage with the new data
8. Success message is displayed to the user

## Security Considerations

- Only authenticated users can update their own profiles
- Email field is read-only to prevent unauthorized changes
- Backend validates all required fields before updating
- Proper error handling for failed updates

## Future Improvements

1. Add avatar/profile picture upload functionality
2. Implement password change functionality
3. Add more comprehensive validation rules
4. Include audit logging for profile changes
