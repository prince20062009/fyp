## Debugging Tools Available

The LoginPage now includes several debugging tools:
1. **Quick Login** - Uses test credentials automatically
2. **Clear Cache** - Clears all authentication-related storage
3. **Reset State** - Reloads the application completely
4. **Test Connection** - Verifies backend connectivity

## Conclusion
