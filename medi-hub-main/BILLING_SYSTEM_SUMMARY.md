# Billing System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the role-based billing system for the Medi-Hub hospital management system. The system has been enhanced to provide different levels of access based on user roles:

1. **Patients** - Can only view their bills and payment options
2. **Doctors** - Can create bills for diagnosis and medicine
3. **Admins** - Have complete access to billing history and management

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Billing Model (`backend/src/models/billing.model.js`)
- Added `doctor` field to reference the doctor who created the bill
- Added `diagnosis` field to store diagnosis information
- Maintained all existing fields for comprehensive billing information

#### Billing Controller (`backend/src/controllers/billing.controller.js`)
- Enhanced `createBill` function to allow both doctors and admins to create bills
- Implemented role-based access control in all functions
- Modified `getPatientBills` to provide simplified view for patients
- Enhanced `getAllBills` to provide complete payment history for admins
- Updated `getBillById` to provide different views based on user role

#### Routes
- Created new doctor-specific billing routes (`backend/src/routes/doctor.billing.routes.js`)
- Updated main billing routes (`backend/src/routes/billing.routes.js`) with proper authentication middleware
- Registered routes in `app.js`

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Doctor Dashboard (`frontend/src/pages/dashboards/DoctorDashboard.jsx`)
- Added "Billing" module to the sidebar navigation
- Created "Billing Management" view showing recent bills
- Implemented "Create New Bill" form with fields for:
  - Patient ID
  - Appointment ID (optional)
  - Diagnosis
  - Bill items (medicine/services)
  - Tax, discount, due date, and notes

#### Patient Dashboard (`frontend/src/pages/dashboards/PatientDashboard.jsx`)
- Enhanced "Billing & Payments" module
- Simplified view showing only bill amounts and payment status
- Added payment modal for processing payments
- Display payment methods (UPI, Bank Transfer)

#### Admin Dashboard (`frontend/src/pages/dashboards/AdminDashboard.jsx`)
- Enhanced billing management with complete bill information
- Added ability to create bills for any patient
- Implemented detailed bill listing with patient information
- Added bill status tracking and management features

### 3. API Utilities (`frontend/src/utils/api.js`)
- Updated billing API functions to support new endpoints
- Maintained consistent error handling and response formats

## Role-Based Access Control

### Patient Access
- **Can**: View their own bills, see bill amounts, see payment status, make payments
- **Cannot**: Create bills, view other patients' bills, see detailed billing information
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - `GET /api/v1/billing` - Get own bills (simplified view)
  - `GET /api/v1/billing/:id` - Get specific bill (simplified view)
  - `PUT /api/v1/billing/:id` - Update payment status

### Doctor Access
- **Can**: Create bills for patients, view bills they created, add diagnosis information
- **Cannot**: View all bills in the system, delete bills, modify other doctors' bills
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/doctor/billing` - Create new bill
  - `GET /api/v1/doctor/billing` - Get bills created by doctor
  - `GET /api/v1/billing/:id` - Get specific bill (detailed view)
  - `PUT /api/v1/billing/:id` - Update payment status

### Admin Access
- **Can**: Create bills for any patient, view all bills, see complete payment history, delete bills
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/billing` - Create new bill
  - `GET /api/v1/billing` - Get own bills (if admin is also a patient)
  - `GET /api/v1/billing/admin` - Get all bills (complete view)
  - `GET /api/v1/billing/:id` - Get specific bill (complete view)
  - `PUT /api/v1/billing/:id` - Update any bill
  - `DELETE /api/v1/billing/:id` - Delete any bill

## Security Features
- All API endpoints are protected with proper authentication
- Role-based middleware ensures users can only access authorized resources
- Patient data is protected and only accessible to authorized personnel
- Doctor-created bills automatically associate the doctor with the bill

## Testing
A test script has been created (`backend/test-billing-roles.js`) to verify the role-based access control functionality.

## Future Enhancements
1. Integration with payment gateways for automated payment processing
2. Email notifications for bill generation and payment confirmations
3. PDF generation for bills
4. Advanced reporting and analytics for financial data
