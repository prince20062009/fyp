# Login Page Diagnosis

## Issue Summary
The login page is not working properly. Users are unable to log in successfully.

## Tests Performed

### 1. Backend API Test
✅ **PASSED** - Direct API calls to `/api/v1/user/simple-login` work correctly:
- Patient login: SUCCESS
- Response includes user data and authentication token
- Role-based redirection would work correctly

### 2. Frontend Component Analysis
The LoginPage.jsx component appears to be correctly implemented:
- Form captures email, password, and role
- Role selection dropdown includes Patient, Doctor, and Admin options
- Form submission triggers the handleLogin function
- Error handling is implemented for various scenarios
- Quick login buttons are available for testing

### 3. Axios Configuration
✅ **PASSED** - The axios configuration is correct:
- baseURL: "http://localhost:8000/api/v1"
- withCredentials: true (for cookie handling)
- Content-Type: application/json

### 4. CORS Configuration
✅ **PASSED** - Backend CORS is configured correctly:
- Allows requests from frontend URL (http://localhost:5173)
- Allows requests from dashboard URL (http://localhost:5174)
- Credentials are enabled

### 5. Environment Variables
⚠️ **WARNING** - Frontend lacks a .env file:
- No custom configuration for API endpoints
- Using default Vite development server on port 5173

## Potential Issues

### 1. React Application Not Running
The most likely issue is that the React frontend application is not running properly. This would prevent:
- User interaction with the login form
- JavaScript execution for form submission
- API calls from being made

### 2. Port Conflicts
- Backend server may have port conflicts (already addressed)
- Frontend development server may need to use a different port

### 3. Browser Console Errors
Without seeing browser console errors, it's difficult to determine the exact issue.

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. Start Frontend Development Server
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

If port 5173 is in use, Vite should automatically select another port.

### 2. Check Browser Console
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Check the Console tab for JavaScript errors
- Check the Network tab to see if API requests are being made

### 3. Verify Component Rendering
- Ensure the LoginPage component is properly routed
- Check if all required dependencies are installed

### 4. Test with Simple HTML Version
A static HTML version of the login page works correctly, confirming that:
- Backend API is functional
- Network connectivity is working
- Authentication logic is sound

## Next Steps

1. Start the frontend development server
2. Navigate to the login page
3. Open browser developer tools
4. Attempt to log in with test credentials
5. Check for any console or network errors
6. Report specific error messages for further diagnosis

## Test Credentials
- Email: test2@example.com
- Password: password123
- Role: Patient (default)

These credentials have been verified to work with direct API calls.
